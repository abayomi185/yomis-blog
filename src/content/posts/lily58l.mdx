My venture into split keyboards was born from wrist pains that I presumed had been because of the long hours I spent sat at my computer desk with an unergonomic setup. I later realised that cycling was the cause after spending on a Lily58L to improve my desk ergonomicsðŸ¥². It is clearly too late now and I've sunken deep into the desire to build more split keyboards, but back to the topic at hand, the Lily58L split keyboard.

[Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58), not to be confused with [Lily58L](https://github.com/Keycapsss/Lily58L-Build-Guide) is an open source split keyboard design that is available on GitHub. Lily58L is a seemingly closed source modification of Lily58 from [Keycapsss](keycapsss.com) that has support for underglow LEDs, per-key LEDs and dual rotary encoders, with the optional addition of a track ball in the position of a rotary encoder. The keyboard also features a number row that I hoped would help ease the transition from my [Keychron K6](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k6-wireless-mechanical-keyboard). And I can't forget the OLED display for the cool factor and I suppose for the somewhat useful information that it is able to show. What I really want on the OLED displays though, is to get [bongocat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongo_Cat) vibing on the displays when I figure out how to set it up. All in all, the Lily58L is a well rounded design that offers all I needed from my first split keyboard build.

Tons of research was carried out, scouring subreddits ([r/ErgoMechKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/), [r/olkb - ortholinear keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/olkb/) and [r/MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/)) for opinions and information on what split keyboard and controller I should choose. I initially wanted to order all parts from the source to reduce complexity but this ended up doing the opposite and likely would have cost more in total. I ended up discovering [Mechboards](http://mechboards.co.uk/), a UK distributor of mechanical keyboard parts, which is where I got my bluetooth keyboard controllers from; the Nice!NanoV2. Mechboards also sell a number of kit to easily get started with a keyboard build.

My component list is as follows

- Lily58L PCB kit from Keycapsss Germany including diodes, 2x 3.5mm jack and WS2812B LEDs
- 2x Nice!NanoV2 from Mechboards UK
- Gateron MX yellow (KS-9) switches and 1100mAh Li-Po batteries from Amazon
- Kailh MX sockets, OLED displays and SK6812 mini-e LEDs from AliExpress

Simple FR4 cases are widely available for the Lily58 but I chose to design and 3D print my keyboard case which is soon to be open source.

The build itself took about 5 hours and the [Lily58L-Build-Guide](https://github.com/Keycapsss/Lily58L-Build-Guide) was very helpful. A few issue were also discovered after soldering, where some components did not make good contact with the pads. This was fixed with a little more heating time with the soldering iron and a generous use of solder.

Fast-forwarding to the next important step of building the keyboard, determining what firmware to run on the keyboard. For wired keyboards, this question does not need to be asked as [QMK](https://qmk.fm) with its broad support and extensibility would provide all that is necessary to get up and running in a matter of minutes. For bluetooth split keyboards on the other hand, [ZMK](https://zmk.dev) is the de-facto firmware.

I shall be updating this article as things change with my current build. I am looking forward to building a smaller sized split keyboard and currently have my eyes on the Corne-LP or Corn-ish Zen.
